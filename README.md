# Lemonade's Policy 2.0

### The world’s first open source insurance policy.

Insurance policies are the ultimate word salad, which is why we’ve created the world’s first open source insurance policy. We’re calling it Policy 2.0.

**Policy 2.0** is a radically simplified, modernized, and digitized insurance policy. It’s open source, so we’d love for everyone to contribute to and benefit from it. Feel free to submit a pull request.

We're taking a run at creating 'Policy 2.0,' with 4 overarching goals: Make a policy that's simple, approachable, relevant, and digital.

**Simple:** Traditional insurance policies are filled with exceptions. Exceptions make actuaries happy, but their costs, in complexity and transparency, are just too high. Zero exceptions may be unrealistic, because the price of such a policy would be unattractive, but the goal must be a radical reduction in exceptions, and ensuring they're easy to understand and remember.


**Approachable:** There are good reasons why policies use lingo that requires a law degree and a broker's license to understand, but Policy 2.0 is about using contemporary English that everyone understands.
And the policy has to be way shorter. No document is 'readable' if it's so long that no one actually reads it.


**Relevant:** Policy 2.0 aims to balance relevant coverage with affordability, while allowing users to choose additional coverage that makes sense for them.


**Digital:** Each Policy 2.0 will be unique and dynamically-generated, based on the choices the user made.
